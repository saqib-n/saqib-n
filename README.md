### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Data Scientist** and **AI Automation Specialist** serving as a strategic **AI Transformation Partner**.

I founded **[WolfXense AI](https://www.wolfxense.agency/)** to close the gap between "having AI" and "using AI." I don't function as a typical vendor who just delivers code and disappears. Instead, I act as a dedicated ally, guiding my clients through the full adoption process—from finding high-impact opportunities and building custom **Agentic AI** systems, to training the workforce to master them.

I don't just build the tech; I ensure it becomes a sustainable competitive advantage.

### 🧠 The Approach (How I Help)

I bridge the gap between business strategy and technical execution. Whether engaging with an enterprise for a full overhaul or an ambitious individual for upskilling, the focus is on practical results.

#### 1. Strategize (The Roadmap)
We start by auditing your needs to identify where AI drives real value—no fluff.
*   **Operational Audits:** Identifying bottlenecks and manual workflows ripe for automation.
*   **Feasibility Analysis:** Assessing technical viability and projecting ROI before building.
*   **Strategic Planning:** Creating a phased roadmap for AI adoption.

#### 2. Build (The Execution)
I architect and engineer systems that do the heavy lifting.
*   **Agentic Workflows:** Autonomous agents that plan, execute, and verify tasks (beyond simple chatbots).
*   **RAG Systems:** Secure pipelines allowing teams to "Chat with Company Data" (Documents, Databases, etc).
*   **Full-Stack Automation:** Integrating AI directly into CRMs, ERPs, and internal tools.

#### 3. Empower (The Education)
Technology fails without human adoption. I train both teams and builders.
*   **Corporate Training:** Upskilling employees to effectively utilize the AI systems we implement.
*   **Individual Mastery:** Specialized coaching for founders and professionals to master Python & Agentic AI.
*   **Internal Governance:** Establishing best practices for safe and compliant AI usage.
